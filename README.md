# CS50-2025
Solutions to the exercises of Harvard's CS50x: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/

Exercises are sorted by the week they were proposed in, comments accompany the code for easier understanding of my reasoning for solving it a certain way, and videos on YouTube will be available in the next few weeks giving a walkthrough of the solution.

Disclaimers
* ATTENTION: Attempt the exercices by yourself first before reaching for the solution.
* This repository was created with edutational intent, and no form of academic dishonesty is encouraged with it (https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/honesty/).
* My goal with this repo is to bring attention to good practices and paradigms, as well as lines of reasoning through a problem that might seem intuitive at first, but requires some non-intuitive logic as to work around the computer's/language's limitations.
* Ultimately, programming is a skill you learn with lots and lots of practice, not by copying/watching others.

Happy coding!
