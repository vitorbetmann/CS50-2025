# CS50-2025
Solutions to the exercises of Harvard's CS50x: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/

Exercises are sorted by the week they were proposed in, comments accompany the code for easier understanding of my reasoning for solving it a certain way, and videos on YouTube will be available in the next few weeks giving a walkthrough of the solution.

Happy coding!
